## Software Testing

I ensure my software is functional using software testing techniques, including automated unit test classes to verify all functionality with a minimum of 80% code coverage. The software is tailored to the user's needs by conducting static analysis on all requirements before coding and writing tests strictly from the requirements specifications. I maintain a single responsibility approach to each component and test to ensure the code is correct and maintainable.

## Software Development Lifecycle 

User stories get created by the development team thinking about requirements by putting themselves in the shoes of their users. This exercise keeps all development user-centric. This approach means I am developing a more valuable product. The agile iterations facilitate this by iterating over plans and increasing details in time. Time boxing user stories to be worked into sprints is a practice I will carry forward in my work to keep me focused and building value with momentum. To be a good team member in software development, one must be fully engaged with the team and fully commited to quality and improvement.
