## Calendar Sync

I created a calendar integration tool that I build to automate a common process I use at work. When I add time off to my personal calendar, I also have to add it to a shared calendar that shows everyone’s time off. My automation script runs when my personal calendar is changed and checks for a time off event’s creation, then adds it to the shared calendar automatically. Runs through Google Apps Script
